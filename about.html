      <h2>Dr. Annama Reddy Chamundeswari</h2>
      <p>
        A woman of strength, resilience, and purpose, Dr. Annama Reddy Chamundeswari has risen above numerous hardships to become a beacon of inspiration for others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Journey of Grit, Grace, and Guidance
      </p>
      <p>
        Born in a small village and raised in a joint family, Dr. Chamundeswari's early life was marked by numerous hardships. Despite facing a lack of support for her education-even from her own parents-she never gave up on her dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
        <p>
            With unwavering determination and a self-motivated spirit, she pursued her education against all odds and carved a path for herself in the field of psychology.
        </p>
        Today, she serves as a professional counselling psychologist and Student Counsellor at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Faculty of Science and Humanities, Ramapuram Campus.
      </p>
      <p>
        She strongly believes that the art of parenting is diminishing in the current generation and emphasizes the need for responsible upbringing and emotional connection. Through her work, she aims to be a catalyst for change among the youth, helping them develop self-awareness, resilience, and a strong moral compass.
