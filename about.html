      <p>
        Born in a small village and raised in a joint family, Dr. Chamundeswari's early life was marked by numerous hardships. Despite facing a lack of support for her education-even from her own parents <span>She never gave</span> up on her dreams.
      


    
        
            With unwavering determination and a self-motivated spirit, she pursued her education against all odds and carved a path for herself in the field of psychology.
        </p>          
        
        
        <p>

        Today, Dr. Annama Reddy Chamundeswari serves as a Professional Counselling Psychologist and Student Counsellor at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Faculty of Science and Humanities, Ramapuram Campus. Her role is not just a jobâ€”it is a mission to uplift and empower the next generation. Every day, she works closely with students who are battling academic pressures, emotional distress, identity crises, and mental health challenges. With her empathetic approach and deep understanding, she helps them find clarity, courage, and confidence.
        She is especially passionate about issues related to modern parenting and youth development. Dr. Chamundeswari strongly believes that the art of parenting is rapidly fading in todayâ€™s society, largely due to the influence of technology, busy lifestyles, and emotional disconnection within families. She advocates for a return to value-based, emotionally rich parenting, where children grow up with love, guidance, discipline, and moral grounding.

<p>Her sessions and talks often focus on building emotional intelligence,<span> self-awareness, mental resilience, and a strong moral compass in young people.</span> She encourages students not just to excel academically, but to become compassionate, self-aware, and responsible citizens. <span>Through her holistic counselling, she provides not only psychological support but also life mentorship.</span>

<p>Beyond her professional achievements, what makes Dr. Chamundeswari truly exceptional is her humility and genuine desire to serve others. She never forgets her roots and continues to use her journey as a source of motivation for those who feel lost or unheard. Her life is a testament to the power of self-belief, and she remains a role model for young women and anyone striving to rewrite their story against all odds.

In a time when the world is in desperate need of kindness, purpose, and human connection, Dr. Annama Reddy Chamundeswari continues to light the wayâ€”a true embodiment of strength, resilience, and compassion.
